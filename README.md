# Lunar Records

I used to own my own music school which with mainly for voice development.I worked with a number of recording studios and created albums for my students. I always thought that the music industry was unfair as they owns thr rights of the artists music. I wanted to create a record label that did not take ownership of artists music and that also was a one stop shop for digital marketing and music editing.  
 
## UX
 
Lunar Records is a record comapany that signs artist/singers. The website allows artists to sign up(sign me). The website provides a one stop shop for artists which includes digital marketing,uploads artits music to streaming sites, provides artits with links to recording studios and video creators. Lunar Records provides a different service as it does not own the rights to the artists music and only takes a small percentage of downloads.
### There are three pages Home, About, Sign Me and Contact. 
- User type-Artist/performer, I want to look for a manager-record deal, so that the artist can achieve a finished piece that can be streamed .



## Features
* I gave the logo a href so that it links back to the home page. 
* I used the color wheel for my colors for font and cards so that there was a color consistency throughout the website
* I embedded music videos that align with the website content. I wanted to use video rather then pictures.
* I added a footer with social media links I found on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp
* I embedded a google map on contact page
* I created a form  for the contact page and stlyed it using css as well as adding a message box. 
* I created a simple diaghrams of the homepage,about and sign me page before I stated to create the website. I then created the form page with boothstrap

### Features Left to Implement
I want to add in the future a page for the up and coming artists as well as a page for ther top 5 artists each week. 
I want to create an algorathim that can work on all music streaming sites that can detect the most popular new artists.
I want to create a seperate page for digital media/marketing.



## Technologies Used

I used mostly HTML and CSS. I spend a considerable amount of time putting bootstrap nav bars on my website but I wasnt sure they were working for me. I searched for creating a navbar with html and css and found one on youtube that I loved It had a simple design that also was mobile responsive. I learned this method and applied that to my website. There was a few lines of java script. I opened a new js file and entered the exact code. It worked well and I was really happy with my navbar. I then changed the colors and font style.
I also used boothstrp to create my form in the contct page. 




## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

I started using my laptop to create my website.The website was also mobile responsive. I also wanted to make the website look well on widescreen so to to that I had to add a centent section in css.This took along time and a geat deal of resarch as the picture was to the right of the widesreen everytime. I tried to add a large picture to only widescreen in css but it did not work. I then found that from research that i could move the picture around the screen easily using the x y position and that worked. 

You should also mention in this section any interest

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
I worked on Sublime text editior for the project and then I saved it on local git. I pushed it to my github repo called 'Lunar' and once the project was ready to deploy I pushed to the github.io repo and i continued to push to this repo as I continued to develop the project and fix anything that I found as I was going through the project. For example on deployment I noticed that there was a difference in display on widescreens. I therefore developed some css rules to handle this issue. (See UX  Section)


## Credits

I found w3schools.com excellent when I was stuck such as when I wanted to create a grid and also for anything I was unsure of or needed to refresh my memory. I also used w3schools for looking at drop down menues but I decided to kepp it simple as I didnt think it would work the way I wanted it on mobile devices. 
I watch many many youtube videos on website desig and layout. As i had a website before I wanted to keep the same kind of simple layout so it is easy to navigate around. 
I used getbootstrap.com. i found that the mini project taught me a great deal on the benefits of using bootstap and I implemented on each page as well as create a boothstrp form that i then styled with CSS. 
### Content
I used many sources for the content please see articles in acknowlegments.  wrote most of the content taking reference from these articles. 

### Media
I created a logo on logomaker which color matches the buttons. 
I used a stock image I already had from my music school for the home page.
I then embeded videos from youtube on the home page, about me and sign me page. Each videos content matches the information that it is aligned to. 

### Acknowledgements

 I was inspired by my past issues with creating music and streaming. I would have liked a one stop shop instead of having to use several different professionls and services for creating music and video. I also read many articles on the new age of music and how record labels are changing as more people are turning to releasing their own music independent of high cost record labels. https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-music-industry-in-an-age-of-digital-distribution/
