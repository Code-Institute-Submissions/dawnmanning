# Lunar Records

I was the owner of a  music school for a number of years, mainly for voice development. I worked with many recording studios and created albums for my students. I always thought that the music industry was unfair as they own the rights of the artists music. I wanted to create a record label that did not take ownership of artists music and that also was a one stop shop for musicians who are looking to get their music out into the public arena.
 
## UX
 
Lunar Records is a record comapany that signs artist/singers. There are four pages on the website- Home, About, Sign Me and Contact.
The website allows artists to sign up(sign me). The website provides a one stop shop for artists which includes digital marketing, uploads artits music to streaming sites, provides artits with links to recording studios and video creators. Lunar Records provides a different service as it does not own the rights to the artists music and only takes a small percentage of downloads.(This information is found on the 'about' page)
 
- User type-Artist/Performer-who are looking for a Manager-Record Deal-This is so that the artist can achieve a finished piece that can be streamed.



## Features
* I gave the logo a href so that it links back to the home page. 
* I used the color wheel for my colors for font and cards so that there was a color consistency throughout the website
* I embedded music videos that align with the website content. I wanted to use video rather then pictures.
* I added a footer with social media links I found on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp
* I made the navbar mobile responsive in that it turns into a hamrburger button.
* I embedded a google map on contact page.
* I created a form  for the contact page and stlyed it using css as well as adding a message box. 
* I created simple diaghrams of the homepage,about and sign me page before I started to create the website. I then created the form page with boothstrap

### Features Left to Implement
* I want to add in the future a page for the up and coming artists as well as a page for ther top 5 artists each week. 
* I want to create an algorathim that can work on all music streaming sites that can detect the most popular new artists.
* I want to create a seperate page for digital media/marketing.
* I want to add a more complex form with the obtion to load video.


## Technologies Used

I used mostly HTML and CSS. I spend a considerable amount of time putting bootstrap nav bars on my website but I wasnt sure they were working for me. I searched for creating a navbar with html and css and found one on youtube that I loved.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg 
It had a simple design that also was mobile responsive. I learned this method and applied it to my website. There was a few lines of java script for the hambuger button. I opened a new js file and entered the exact code. It worked well and I was really happy with my navbar. I then changed the colors and font style.(google font)
I also used boothstrap to create my form in the contact page. 


## Testing

The website is working with all buttoms sucessfully loading the four pages. 
There are four pages all work well and are mobile and widescreen responsive. 

1. Contact Form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   

2. I started using my laptop to create my website. The website was also mobile responsive. I also wanted to make the website look well on widescreen so to do that I had to add a centent section in css. This took along time and a geat deal of research as the picture was to the right of the widesreen everytime I refreshed the page. I tried to add a large picture to only widescreen in css but it did not work. I then found that from research that I could move the picture around the screen easily using the x y position and that worked. 


## Deployment
I worked on Sublime text editior for the project as gitpod was not always working on my laptop and then I saved it on local git. I pushed it to my github repo called 'Lunar' and once the project was ready to deploy I pushed to the github.io repo and i continued to push to this repo as I continued to develop the project and fix anything that I found needed fixing as I was going through the project. For example on deployment I noticed that there was a difference in display on widescreens. I therefore developed some css rules to handle this issue.


## Credits

I found w3schools.com excellent when I was stuck such as when I wanted to create a grid and also for anything I was unsure of or needed to refresh my memory. I also used w3schools for looking at drop down menues but I decided to kepp it simple as I didnt think it would work the way I wanted it to on mobile devices. 
I watched many many youtube videos on website design and layout. As I had a website before(wordpress) I wanted to keep the same kind of simple layout so it would be easy to navigate around. 
I used https//:www.getbootstrap.com. I found that the mini project taught me a great deal on the benefits of using bootstrap and I implemented on each page as well as create a bootstrap form that I then styled with CSS. 
### Content
I used many sources for the content (please see articles in acknowlegments). I wrote most of the content taking reference from these articles and from my own work experience in the music industry. 

### Media
I created a logo on logomaker which color matches the buttons. 
I used a stock image I already had from my music school for the home page.
I then embeded videos from youtube on the home page, about me and sign me page. Each videos content matches the information that it is aligned to. 

### Acknowledgements

I was inspired by my past issues with creating music and streaming. I would have liked a one stop shop instead of having to use several different professionals and services for creating music and video. I also read many articles on the new age of music and how record labels are changing as more people are releasing their own music independent of high cost record labels. https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-music-industry-in-an-age-of-digital-distribution/
